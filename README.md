The Odin Project: Recipes

In this section of The Odin Project, I learned to apply the lessons from the beggining up to this point.

What I've Learned:
1. How to link the repository from GitHub to a local computer
2. Git commands
3. Navigating GitHub
4. What's a SSH Key and why we use it instead of HTTP (for security reasons)
5. HTML boilerplate
6. HTML basics
7. Publish web projects

What Can I Improve:
I had trouble linking the repo to my computer. It took me quite some time and a lot of troubleshooting.
I figured I need to understand the arrangement of my repository folders and practice linking them.

Conclusion:
I had a blast on the HTML part. Also I downloaded a VSC theme, it makes my code so pretty to look at and
its fun to see your code come to life haha! 
Overall, I'm proud for getting through the first project and I'm excited for the upcoming projects.

    <title>Hawaiian Pizza</title>
    <p>
        A legendary flavour that makes people question it. The Hawaiian pizza was invented
        by a Greek living in Canada. 
        <br>
        With the rice of sweet-and-savory dishes, he decided to
        try something unusual: adding canned pineapple to a pizza <br>
        along with ham.
    </br>

        <br>The pineapple brand he used was called “Hawaiian,” 
        which is how the pizza got its name! 
        <br>No deeper tropical cultural connection!
        Despite the controversy, Hawaiian pizza spread worldwide. 
        <br>Today it’s considered a classic menu item—beloved, hated, and memed forever.
